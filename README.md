## My process
The build of this tiny project was kind of a challenge for me, since I'm a little rusty on html and css, but with some help of google I could overcome it. 
The hardest part was to center the box of the content, I hadn't fully understanded the distinctions between align/justify, items/contents. 

*I want to keep improving my habilities on building fuller and bigger sites, acknowleging the tools and understanding that everything takes time and practice*

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
